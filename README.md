# StickSmiths – Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired

This repository documents the development of a Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired, built as part of the Makers Asylum Winter Program 2025. The project aims to improve independent mobility for visually impaired users through real-time obstacle detection and intuitive feedback.

The walking stick integrates distance sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect obstacles and alert the user using vibration motors and a buzzer. The system is powered by a lithium-ion battery with onboard charging and is housed in a lightweight, modular structure designed using CAD and fabricated through 3D printing and PVC construction.
