# 🔧 Circuit Diagrams & CAD Files

This folder contains all design files related to the electronics and physical structure of the Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired project. These files document the evolution of the system from early concepts to the current working prototype.

The contents of this directory include circuit diagrams used for wiring and testing the electronic components, as well as CAD files for 3D-printed parts such as the electronics enclosure and mounting components. Together, these files support replication, modification, and further development of the project.

📐 Circuit Diagrams

This section includes schematic diagrams representing the electrical connections between the ESP32, ultrasonic sensors, vibration motors, buzzer, power management modules, and other components. These diagrams were used during prototyping and debugging to ensure correct wiring and reliable system behavior.

Files may include:

Schematic diagrams (PDF / PNG)

Breadboard or wiring reference diagrams

Iterative versions reflecting design changes

### 🧱 CAD Files

This section contains CAD models used to design and fabricate the physical components of the walking stick. These include enclosures and structural parts intended for 3D printing and integration with the PVC-based frame.

Files may include:

3D enclosure designs

Mounts and holders for sensors and electronics

Iterative CAD versions reflecting measurement and fit adjustments

### ♻️ Notes

CAD files may go through multiple revisions as the design is refined.

Printed parts should be tested for fit before final assembly.

Refer to the GitHub Wiki for context on design decisions and daily progress.
